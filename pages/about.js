                I am an User Experience Designer and Front-End Developer based
                in Denmark. I recently graduated from the IT University of
                Copenhagen, where I studied a Master of Science in Information
                Technology (Cand.it in Digital Design and Interactive
                Technologies). Lately, I have been working as an Assistant
                Lecturer at the IT University of Copenhagen.

                I would describe myself as a Design-Oriented Front-End Developer
                â€” meaning that I enjoy both designing and developing digital
                products and services. I especially like doing UX Research, UX
                Design, Service Design and Front-End Development. Moreover, I am
                fond of accessibility and strongly believe in the WCAG
                principles.
